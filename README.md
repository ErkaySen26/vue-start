# Vue.js Fundamentals Learning

This project aims to learn and understand the fundamental concepts of Vue.js by building a simple interactive web application. The goal is to explore Vue.js features such as data binding, event handling, conditional rendering, list rendering, and more.

## Features:
- **Data Binding**: Binding URL and book information to the template.
- **Event Handling**: Handling events like mouseover, mouseleave, dblclick, and mousemove to update the UI.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Display or hide a list of books using `v-if` directive.
- **List Rendering**: Rendering a list of books dynamically and toggling their favorite status.
- **Computed Properties**: Filtering and displaying only the favorite books using a computed property.

## Technologies Used:
- **Vue.js**: The main framework for building the user interface.
- **HTML/CSS**: For basic webpage structure and styling.

## How to Run:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Ensure you have internet access to load Vue.js from a CDN.

## Project Structure:
- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the application.
- `app.js`: The Vue.js application script.
